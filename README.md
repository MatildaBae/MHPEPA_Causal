# MHPAEA Causal Inference Study 🧠📊

## Overview 🌟
This project investigates the causal effect of the **Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA)** on the utilization of mental health services and specialist consultations. The MHPAEA, enacted in 2008, mandates parity between mental health/substance use disorder (MH/SUD) benefits and medical/surgical benefits in group health plans and health insurance coverage. The focus of this study is to compare the **average treatment effect (ATE)** between individuals who received the treatment (those with private insurance) and those who did not. 

The study uses a **Difference-in-Differences (DID)** approach to estimate the causal effect, comparing pre- and post-treatment differences between the treatment and control groups. Additionally, the analysis adjusts for confounders using **propensity score matching**, ensuring more accurate comparison between groups.

## Objective 🎯
- **Primary Goal**: Estimate the causal effect of MHPAEA on the utilization of mental health services by comparing the treatment group (private insurance holders) with the control group (non-private insurance holders).
- **Methodology**: 
  - **Difference-in-Differences (DID)**: To compare the pre- and post-treatment effects between the treatment and control groups.
  - **Propensity Score Matching (PSM)**: To adjust for confounding variables and make the treatment and control groups comparable.

## Data 📑
- **Treatment Group**: Individuals with private insurance who are eligible for MHPAEA.
- **Control Group**: Individuals without private insurance who are not eligible for MHPAEA.
- **Variables**:
  - **Treatment**: Whether the individual has private insurance (treated) or not (control).
  - **Outcome**: Utilization of mental health services and specialist consultations.
  - **Covariates**: Age, gender, socioeconomic status, health conditions, etc.

## Approach 🔍
1. **Data Preprocessing** 🧹:
   - Clean and merge datasets containing information on insurance status, mental health service utilization, and relevant covariates.
   - Identify eligible individuals based on insurance status.

2. **Propensity Score Matching** 🔄:
   - Estimate propensity scores using logistic regression or other suitable methods.
   - Match individuals in the treatment and control groups based on the estimated propensity scores to reduce bias due to confounders.

3. **Difference-in-Differences (DID)** 📉:
   - Implement DID to estimate the effect of MHPAEA by comparing changes in utilization before and after the law’s implementation between the treatment and control groups.

4. **Statistical Analysis** 📊:
   - Perform robustness checks and sensitivity analysis to assess the validity of the causal estimates.

## Future Work 🚀
- Further refine the propensity score matching method.
- Explore other potential treatment effects, such as subgroup analysis based on demographics.
- Investigate the long-term impact of MHPAEA on mental health outcomes.
